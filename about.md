Hi!  I'm Jeff Yeung, an engineer living in the Greater Detroit Area.  I am passionate about using technology to improve the future of our society and world.  I also enjoy feeding people heaps of food, taking landscape photography that captures a fragment of God's creation, and serving in the community, particularly with families, as I see that as the foundational building block of society.

I currently work at Ford Motor Company in the research department on next-gen mobility technologies.  I have background in multiple facets of science and engineering, from physics to biomedical engineering and cancer genomics to electrical and software engineering.  Here is my [GitHub](https://github.com/jbyeung)
