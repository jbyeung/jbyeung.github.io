This year, in lieu of any new year's resolutions (which I normally don't make - because really, you shouldn't need a new year to make goals), I decided to do the Maker Challenge.  This is a list of things I want to make this year - foods, projects, hacks, writings, ideas.  

[Jeff's Maker Challenge](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PZW5yDg5pPCHIhhwgW4nG17uZn1w1zkrRuF-rJCwB88)

The inspiration is from [Mega Maker](http://megamaker.co)

I made this list and showed it to my wife, and now I finally have finished one of my items - to start this website - I can chronicle the items here.  I've meant to start this site for a while so I can blog about things I want to make or societal trends, and also give myself some web presence for a portfolio.  

But I never started it, even though I planned it out year after year after year. 

Why did that happen?  I realized I'm great at setting goals, and even at strategizing them out and organizing to-do lists, but I'm terrible at finishing things.

So now I have this list up in a Google Doc makes it easier to track history and share it, and also access it anywhere) - I have it in a pinned tab right next to my Inbox and OneTab (https://www.one-tab.com/ - best extension you'll ever install in Chrome).  I have a weekly recurring Wunderlist task to review the MakerList and see if I need to break out other tasks to knock off some more items.  And when I think of new ideas, I add them to the list.

And then I do them, very slowly that is.  But now I have a published list and accountability - I'm sharing this on Facebook also, with people who know me in real life and i see on a weekly basis.

Will I finish?  Probably not all of them, but then that will give me feedback for 2017 as to how to plan my time better, adjust for life circumstances, and be more realistic about my time estimates (I have iterated on this and added some rough time requirements, something I learned in software development).

You'll see my list has a mix of small personal things, like recipes I want to master, and larger projects that are still yet unformed and simply rough ideas.  But I'll have to do them.

At a later date, I'll link that document and my website up so it's right here and always updated live.  (I'll have to figure out how to do that but that means I have to learn more.)

So there you have it.  You should also take up the Maker Challenge, even if you aren't an engineer or work in a field about "making things".  Everyone is a maker, whether you make lesson plans or "make" growth in kids (like my wife, a teacher) or "make" a home or you make improvements in your life.  

It's all about the spirit of being making rather than simply consuming things that other's have made.  It's easy to consume, it takes little thought or initiative.  Making requires risk, commitment, and effort.
